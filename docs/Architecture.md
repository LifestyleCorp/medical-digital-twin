Detailed architecture description

# Architecture Overview

## Overview

The Human Digital Twin system is designed with a modular architecture, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. Below is a high-level overview of the system components and their interactions.

## Components

1. **Backend**
   - **Django REST Framework API:** Handles all API requests, data processing, and simulation logic.
   - **Simulation Engine:** Core component responsible for running complex simulations of cellular interactions.
   - **Database:** PostgreSQL for relational data storage and MongoDB for unstructured data.

2. **Frontend**
   - **React.js Application:** User interface for interacting with the digital twin, configuring simulations, and viewing results.
   - **Three.js Integration:** For 3D visualizations of simulations.
   - **Data Visualization:** Charts and graphs using libraries like D3.js.

3. **Infrastructure**
   - **Docker Containers:** Encapsulate backend, frontend, and database services for consistent deployment.
   - **Docker Compose:** Orchestrates multi-container Docker applications.
   - **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing, building, and deployment using GitHub Actions.

4. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive documentation hosted within the `docs/` directory, including API specs, user guides, and architectural diagrams.

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**
   - Users interact with the React frontend to configure simulation parameters.

2. **API Requests**
   - Frontend sends API requests to the Django backend to initiate simulations.

3. **Simulation Processing**
   - Backend processes the simulation using the simulation engine and stores results in the database.

4. **Visualization**
   - Frontend retrieves simulation data and renders interactive 3D visualizations and analytics.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python, Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Frontend:** React.js, Three.js, D3.js, Axios
- **DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions
- **Testing:** Pytest, Jest, React Testing Library
