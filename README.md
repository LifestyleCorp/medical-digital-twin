## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](assets/architecture.png)

The Human Digital Twin architecture is modular, ensuring scalability and flexibility:

1. **Data Layer**: Aggregates and manages biological and medical data from various sources.
2. **Simulation Engine**: Core component that runs simulations at cellular, tissue, and organ levels.
3. **Integration Layer**: Ensures seamless communication between different modules.
4. **Visualization Module**: Provides interactive 3D representations of simulations.
5. **API Gateway**: Facilitates external integrations and access to simulation data.
6. **User Interface**: Intuitive dashboards and tools for researchers and healthcare professionals.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later, macOS Catalina or later, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Node.js**: 14.x or higher
- **Docker**: 20.x or higher
- **Git**: Latest version

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/human-digital-twin.git
   cd human-digital-twin
   ```

2. **Setup Backend**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Setup Frontend**

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run Docker Containers**

   Ensure Docker is running on your system.

   ```bash
   cd ..
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. **Access the Application**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

### Running Simulations

1. **Start the Simulation Engine**

   Ensure the backend services are running. If using Docker, they should be up after `docker-compose` command.

2. **Configure Simulation Parameters**

   Use the provided UI to set parameters such as cell types, organ systems, and environmental conditions.

3. **Execute Simulation**

   Click on the "Run Simulation" button to start. Monitor progress via real-time analytics and visualizations.

4. **Analyze Results**

   View detailed reports, 3D visualizations, and export data for further analysis.
